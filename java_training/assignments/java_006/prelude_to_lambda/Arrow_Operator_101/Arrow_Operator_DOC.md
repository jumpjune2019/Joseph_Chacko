# Overview:

	This documentation provides an overview of how the ARROW operator is used in JavaScript for functional 
	programming and the pros and cons of using it. 

# Arrow Operator:
Arrow operators are syntaxes for writing function expressions. 
It uses the  => token.   It reduces the function code size without its own bindings like the 
**this, argument, super or new.target** keywords.

Pros:
- Reduce Code Size
- No need to define a Return statement for one line functions
- Lexically bind the context
<br>
<br />

Cons: 

- The Objects cannot be constructors
- They don’t bind an arguments object.

# Test Samples:

- <script> 
  		  setDoubleSize = (sz)=>size=2*sz; 
   		 setDoubleSize(35); 
   		 document.write(size);     
      
 </script> 	

- var materials = [ 'Hydrogen',  'Helium',  'Lithium', 'Beryllium'];

console.log(materials.map(material => material.length));

# Conclusion:

		The Arrow operator work well with callback functions, but doesn’t work with object
		methods and constructors.
